    - Design a system for sending notifications (email, push notification).
    - Implement a mechanism for handling user preferences and notification settings.
    - Send notifications to relevant users and their devices.
- Dependencies:
    - Database table: Users
    - Database table: Notifications

**Task 4: Allow users to like and comment on other posts**

- Complexity estimate: Medium
- Technical considerations:
    - Implement a relationship between users and posts through the likes and comments tables.
    - Design a system for handling likes and comments (e.g., incrementing counters, storing timestamps).
    - Securely store user preferences and interactions.
- Dependencies:
    - Database table: Users
    - Database table: Posts

**Task 5: Integrate social media authentication so users can sign in with their existing social media credentials**

- Complexity estimate: High
- Technical considerations:
    - Implement social media authentication providers for various platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).

- Complexity estimate: High
- Technical considerations:
    - Design a database table for storing and searching posts (title, content, tags).
    - Implement a search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) for efficient data retrieval.
    - Allow users to filter posts by various criteria (e.g., date, location, tags).
- Dependencies:
    - Database table: Posts
    - Search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch)

**Additional Considerations:**

- Implement proper security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Design a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
